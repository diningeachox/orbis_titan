# Dev Documentation

## Overview
This project is based on a small template for building a 2D JS game, it includes:
- ECS (entity-component-system)
- Scene management
- WebGL Renderer pipeline
- 2D Vector math (supports +, -, dot product, modulus, scalar multiplication, elementwise multiplication, projection, normalization, 2D rotation)
- Collision detection
- Custom font management (fairly straightforward)

This project is based on canvas elements in HTML, no SVG elements are used.

## Usage
There are apps which let you setup your own server on your local machine. If you're using Chrome, I recommend [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en)

Once installed, follow the steps below:
1. Start the server
2. Point to the root directory of this project
3. Click the link given to run the game (index.html)

## To Do:
[] - Make this into a node.js app (which is what should've been done to begin with).
